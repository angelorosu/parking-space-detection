# parking-space-detection
Analyze video footage to detect occupied and empty parking spots in real-time 


Step 1: Load and process video frames \
Step 2: Create a mask for each parking spot \
Step 3: Analyze each frame and detect occupied and empty parking spots \
Step 4: Visualize the results 


Please note that the implementation provided above only focuses on the occupied or empty status of the parking spots. The real-time analysis, tracking, and counting of vehicles entering and exiting parking spots require a more advanced algorithm, such as using machine learning and computer vision techniques.
